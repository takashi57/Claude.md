# CTO Claude.md
A fellow CTO-styled claude.md instruction file that follows best engineering practices and attempts to mitigate undesirable LLM development behaviors

To use this Claude.md, either clone this repo to move this file to your own project or copy and paste this into your project. You can delete this part but there is a section of the Claude.md file that states: 
"### Current State
Read `<insert any claude context>` for context for historical context and past implementation details for the current webapp. We are currently working on claude_PRD-xxx.md."

I've found this is help for instructions on what to read previously and what we're currently doing now to start the session with maximum context.
