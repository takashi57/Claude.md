# CTO Claude.md
A fellow CTO-styled claude.md instruction file that follows best engineering practices and attempts to mitigate undesirable LLM development behaviors

To use this Claude.md, either clone this repo to move this file to your own project or copy and paste this into your project. You can delete this part but there is a section of the Claude.md file that states: 
This Project
Current State
Read <insert historical context> for historical context and past implementation details.

Tech Stack
Backend: insert description of backend
Frontend: insert description of frontend
Data: insert description of database
Read ADR folders for latest architecture design decisions and current architecture
Tools
only if applicable
Key Files
insert file path - brief description of file

where you'll want to replace this with your own code context.

I've found this is help for instructions on what to read previously and what we're currently doing now to start the session with maximum context.
